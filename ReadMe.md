# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### The client, Louise, is fundraising for her play *Fever* that she wants to produce. As she nears her fundraising goal, she would like to know different campaigns' success/fail rates in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Formatting the line chart in such a way that organized the X axis in ascending order was a bit of a challenge for me. In order to overcome this challenge, I created a Pivot Table, moved the *Goal* data so that it is in ascending order, and created the line chart based on those changes.

## Results
- As is portrayed in the data based on launch date, the most successful month of the year for plays is May. In comparison to the rest of the months of the year, May shows a very sharp increase in success rate, as there are over 100 successful campaigns in this time frame. While throughout the entire year there are consistently more successful campaigns as opposed to failed campaigns, December is not a very successful month. Successful outcomes decrease greatly during this month, almost to the same degree of failed outcomes in the same time frame.
- In regards to the data based on goals, it seems that less is more. The data shows that the highest percentage of success comes from campaigns with the lowest goals: less than $1,000.
- There are some limitations to this dataset. For instance, we do not see how close the failed campaigns were to reaching their goals, or whether there is a correlation between the goal amounts and the launch times.
- To get a bigger picture and a more detailed story, we could chart the amount raised for the failed campaigns in order to see how close they were to reaching their goals. We could also visualize the data in regards to the relationship between the average goals in the most successful months.
